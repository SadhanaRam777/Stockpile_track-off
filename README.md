# Stockpile_track-off
This proposed structure aims to screen distribution center boundaries like temperature, dampness, CO, movement,
and smoke which are exceptionally impacted to grains. The ESP32 Wi-Fi module gathers the
information from the sensors and this module sends information to the Node-red dashboard through
the MQTT agent. Numerous IoT hubs are to be introduced at alternate areas inside the distribution
center which will give data about the stockroom climate to the ranchers through Mobile SMS and E-
mail notice.
